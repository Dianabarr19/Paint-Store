# Paint-Store

This is a project (of a collection of 77) from the Codecademy's Front-End Engineer career path course.
This is a simple static website coded with HTML and CSS.
The purpose of this project was to get familiarized with the four ways to represent color in CSS: 
<ol>
<li>Named colors, </li>
<li>Hexadecimal or hex colors</li>
<li>RGB</li>
<li>HSL</li>
<li>We can ass opacity to color in RGB and HSL by adding a fouth value: <strong>a</strong> which is represented as a percentage</li>
</ol>
